Plan for analysis

The basic analysis will test the extent of AVE movement.

Movement
--------
1) Centroid of AVE cells by time
2) Average speed of AVE cells by time
3) Average velocity of AVE cells by time

Contiguity
---------
1) Number of AVE clusters by time

Shape
-----
1) Average shape index
2) Average perimeter
3) Average eccentricity
